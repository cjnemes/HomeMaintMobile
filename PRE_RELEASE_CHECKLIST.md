   - ✓ Category and location pickers show all options (not just "None")
   - ✓ Asset appears in list
   - ✓ Asset detail view loads

3. **Task Management**
   - ✓ Create task (with and without asset)
   - ✓ Filter by status (All, Pending, Overdue, Upcoming, Completed)
   - ✓ Filter by priority
   - ✓ Search tasks
   - ✓ Toggle completion via checkbox
   - ✓ Edit task
   - ✓ Delete task

4. **Service Providers**
   - ✓ Create provider (company name required, contact optional)
   - ✓ List shows company name as primary
   - ✓ Detail view shows company as title

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "No Provisioning Profiles Found"
- Open Xcode preferences → Accounts
- Select your Apple ID
- Download Manual Profiles (or use Automatic signing)

### "Untrusted Developer"
- On iPhone: Settings → General → VPN & Device Management
- Tap your developer certificate → Trust

### Database Issues
- Delete app from simulator/device
- Clean build folder (⌘⇧K)
- Rebuild and reinstall

### Categories/Locations Still Show "None"
- This should be fixed now
- If it occurs: Delete app, reinstall
- Check console for "✅ Database seeding complete" message
